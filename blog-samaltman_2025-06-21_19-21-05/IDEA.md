üß† Concept: "Mentor Mirror" ‚Äî Learn & Reflect by Emulating Great Minds

Problem: Self-improvement resources (like Paul Graham essays or Meditations) are dense and passive. People often read but don‚Äôt act.

Solution: Scrape writings of thinkers (Paul Graham, Marcus Aurelius, Naval, etc.), analyze them using NLP to:

    Summarize their core ideas,

    Extract habits, patterns, or reflective prompts,

    Generate actionable steps tailored for the user.

üí° Example Use Cases

    Paul Graham ‚Üí Writing prompts + decision frameworks for startup ideas.

    Marcus Aurelius ‚Üí Daily reflection journal + Stoic reminder generator.

    Naval Ravikant ‚Üí Mental models + habit-building tasks.

Storage

    SQLite (for simplicity)

    Or Supabase / Firebase for plug-and-play auth + storage if needed.

Bonus APIs/Tools

‚öôÔ∏è MVP Workflow Example

    User selects mentor (Paul Graham, Marcus Aurelius, Naval, etc.)

    Scraper pulls relevant text (e.g., essays or books)

    LLM processes text:

        Summarizes core themes.

        Extracts habits, mental models, or reflections.

        Generates actionable daily/weekly tasks.

    Output:

        Daily ‚ÄúMentor-gram‚Äù: 1 quote, 1 action, 1 reflection question.

        Custom Notion page or journaling UI.

    User logs reflections, optionally voice input ‚Üí summarized weekly.

üöÄ Stretch Goals

    User Personalization: Ask a few onboarding questions to tailor which mentor is best fit.

    Habit Tracker Integration: Track actions taken from mentors.

    Gamify Learning: XP for doing actions, reflecting, staying consistent.

‚úÖ What to Focus on in 24 Hours

    Pick ONE mentor (e.g., Paul Graham) to scope MVP.

    Build:

        Scraper for his essays.

        Summarizer + Action Generator (via GPT API).

        Minimal UI to display quote + task + reflection.

        Optional: log reflection and show history.

üß™ Quick Experiment

Here‚Äôs a GPT prompt you could use in your backend:

You are a personal mentor coach. Take the following excerpt from Paul Graham's essay and:
1. Summarize the core idea in 2 sentences.
2. Translate the idea into a concrete action someone can take today.
3. Pose a self-reflection question based on it.
